# <Checkers Software Application>

## Description

- Conducted in COSC301-01 Software Engineering at St. Mary's College of Maryland.
- This project was created to practice working in a mock software engineering team to develop high quality software in a realistic setting. This included writing all documentation (SDP,SRS,TM,SDD,STP) following an incremental process model following the fundamental phases in the software engineering process.
- It solved the problem of how to create high quality software according to the customer by conducting peer reviews, requirements meetings, and mock prototypes.
- I learned the importance of documentatiom and how to formally create software following an iteratice process model.

- [Installation](#installation) No installation necessary.

## Installation

As a software requirement, the software shall not include any installation. The consumer shall be able to open the file of the software which will run the program with no installation.
